# cra-template-tailwind-post-css
This is a create-react-app template for creating a react app with tailwind-css and post-css already templated in.

## Info
The tailwind CSS was generated with `npx tailwind init tailwind.config.js -full` so everything is generated. But feel free to delete `tailwind.config.js` and generate your own tailwind configuration file.

## Usage
Use it by typing in your console
```
npx create-react-app app-name --template tailwind-post-css
```
